### 📚 About me

I'm a naturally curious person, currently developing into a true digital Swiss Army knife 🛠️. I love technology, learning new things, and taking on challenges that push me out of my comfort zone.

Right now, I'm learning:

- 💻 **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**
- 🎨 **Graphic design** (learning on the fly to help with my family's print shop 😅)
- 🇬🇧 Practicing English (yes, including this README!)

### 🚧 Projects in Progress

I don’t have public repos yet, but I’m working on a few cool ideas. Coming soon:

- A personal portfolio
- JavaScript mini-projects
- Creative stuff mixing code and design
